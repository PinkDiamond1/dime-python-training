# DIME's Python Training for Stata Users
There are many great Python trainings across the internet,
and they all are great in their own niche.
The niche of this Python training is to help researchers
who are already advanced coders in Stata transition to using Python.
This training will therefore not take time to discuss questions like:
"What is programming used for?" or
"What is an if-condition or a loop/iteration?",
but instead simply focus on how such concepts are implemented in Python.
One of the main benefits of Python is that it is extremely versatile,
and can be used for anything from data science,
web servers, or robots; among many other examples.
But this training will only focus on what a typical microeconomics researcher needs.
If this description fits you, then we think that this training will be great for you.
But if this description does not fit you,
then there might be a training better suited for you elsewhere on the big internet.
