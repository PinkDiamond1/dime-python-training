# Data processing in Python using Pandas

## Session description

Pandas is a very popular Python library that is used
to process and transform data.
This session will introduce DataFrames and Series,
the basic data structures of Pandas,
along with the most commonly used data processing operations.
We will establish analogies between how these data structures
and operations are represented and performed in Stata.
The session does not require any installation prerequisites
but it does require participants to have basic Python knowledge.

**Note:** Participants who do not have prior knowledge of Python
and are interested in joining this session can do so after
reviewing the materials of our introductory Python training
(available [here](https://osf.io/agn68/)).
We also strongly recommend reviewing
our introductory session to working with APIs
(available [here](https://osf.io/64zjp/)).
